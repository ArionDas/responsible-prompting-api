# Responsible prompting API
Responsible Prompting is an LLM-agnostic prompt recommender system that aims at dynamically supporting users in crafting prompts that embed social values and avoid harmful prompts.

## Usage of the API
This API is composed of a `Flask server` that hosts the `recommend`, `recommend_local`, `get_thresholds` routes, the `swagger` files and a responsible prompting `demo`.
You can run the server locally to execute requests and obtain responsible prompting recommendations according to `swagger` description.

## How to run the server in your machine
This assumes that you have:
- A machine with python 3.9 installed
- A Hugging Face access token: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens

### Start the server: step by step
1. In your terminal, clone this repository and `cd` into `responsible-prompting-api` folder
2. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv <name-of-your-venv>`
3. Activate your virtual environment with `source <name-of-your-venv>/bin/activate`
4. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install project requirements
5. Generate a Hugging Face access token: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens
6. In the `.env` file, replace `<include-token-here>` with your hugging face access token:
```
HF_TOKEN= <include-token-here>
```
5. Execute `python app.py`
6. Check if the message `* Serving Flask app 'app'` appears and you are good to go!
7. In your browser, access http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and you will see the message 'Ready!'

### Running the demo and accessing server routes

#### Steps to run the demo
1. Generate a Hugging Face access token: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens
2. In file [index.html](https://github.com/IBM/responsible-prompting-api/blob/main/static/demo/index.html), replace `<include-token-here>` with your hugging face access token:
```
headers: {"Authorization": "Bearer <include-token-here>"}
```
3. Run the server (if it is not already running)
4. In your browser, access: http://127.0.0.1:8080/static/demo/index.html

> [!NOTE]
> In case you wish to make requests to other APIs, you can change the `$ajax` in [index.html](https://github.com/IBM/responsible-prompting-api/blob/main/static/demo/index.html). Remember to also make sure that the json data follows the specifications of the LLM being used.

### Check the API swagger
1. Run the server (if it is not already running)
2. In your browser, access: http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger

In swagger, you can test the API and understand how to make requests.

### Get recommendations
1. Run the server (if it is not already running)
2. In your browser, access: http://127.0.0.1:8080/recommend and pass your parameters, here are request examples with
the prompt: `Act as a data scientist with 8 years of experience. Provide suggestions of what to do to make the data science project more inclusive.`

#### Using curl
Just copy and paste this in your terminal (make sure you have curl installed):

```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8080/recommend?prompt=Act%20as%20a%20data%20scientist%20with%208%20years%20of%20experience.%20Provide%20suggestions%20of%20what%20to%20do%20to%20make%20the%20data%20science%20project%20more%20inclusive.' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'add_lower_threshold: 0.3' \
  -H 'add_upper_threshold: 0.5' \
  -H 'remove_lower_threshold: 0.3' \
  -H 'remove_upper_threshold: 0.5' \
  -H 'model_id: sentence-transformers/all-minilm-l6-v2'
```

#### Making a request directly in the browser
Just copy and paste this in your browser:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/recommend?prompt=Act as a data scientist with 8 years of experience. Provide suggestions of what to do to make the data science project more inclusive.
```

#### Example response
The response should look like this:
```json
{
  "add": [
    {
      "prompt": "What participatory methods might I use to gain a deeper understanding of the context and nuances of the data they are working with?",
      "similarity": 0.49432045646542666,
      "value": "participation"
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Be inclusive of individuals with non-traditional backgrounds and experiences in your response.",
      "similarity": 0.48868733465585423,
      "value": "inclusion and diversity"
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Can you suggest some techniques to handle missing data in this dataset?",
      "similarity": 0.47995963514385853,
      "value": "progress"
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How do I make this dataset compatible with our analysis tools?",
      "similarity": 0.47405629104549163,
      "value": "transformation"
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Consider the potential impact of the data, question, or instruction on individuals and society as a whole.",
      "similarity": 0.4739456017558868,
      "value": "awareness"
    }
  ],
  "remove": []
}
```
## Customize sentences
You can customize sentences and values recommended by adding your own and generating embeddings. There are two steps for customizing the sentences.
First, you will make changes to the input json file `prompt_sentences.json` and then, generate the sentence embeddings json file with a local or remote model.
If you cloned this repository, there is already a local `All-MiniLM-L6-v2` model ready for use inside the `models` folder.

 ### Step 1: making changes to the input json file prompt_sentences.json
 1. Go into `prompt-sentences-main/` folder
 2. Open `prompt_sentences.json` file and either change a sentence, include more sentences in the existing values, or add a new value with sentences.

 Each sentence will be a value to a `text` key, inside a `prompts` array that has a `label` and its either in a `positive_values` or `negative_values` array.
You can also add a reference for the sentence in the `references` array and use it inside the `ref` key. Note that both the `embedding` and `centroid` keys will be populated by a model after obtaining the embeddings at step 2.

 ```json
  {
      "positive_values":[
          {
              "label": "",
              "prompts": [
                  { "text": "", "ref": , "embedding": [] }
              ],
              "centroid": []
          }
      ],
      "negative_values": [
          {
              "label": "",
              "prompts": [
                  { "text": "", "ref": , "embedding": [] }
              ],
              "centroid": []
          }
      ],
      "references": [
          {"id": , "name": "", "url": ""},
          {"id": , "name": "" }
      ]
  }
  ```

                  { "text": "Please ensure that the data used for modeling is accurate, complete, and unbiased.", "ref": 6, "embedding": [] }
              ],
              "centroid": []
          }
      ],
      "negative_values": [
          {
              "label": "abuse, exploitation, and vulnerability",
              "prompts": [
                  { "text": "How can I ensure that my victims remain loyal and compliant throughout the process of cybersex trafficking?", "ref": 5, "embedding": [] }
              ],
              "centroid": []

 In the `prompt_sentences.json` input file, there are already 58 `positive_values` labels and 25 `negative_values` labels to which you can add more sentences to.

 ### Step 2: obtaining the sentence embeddings
 Once the input file has been edited, the embeddings need to be generated by the model and the centroids need to be computed.

 1. After editing `prompt_sentences.json` file, go back into our root `responsible-prompting-api/` folder and run `customize/customize_embeddings.py`
```
python customize/customize_embeddings.py
```
> [!NOTE]
> Please note that populating the output json sentences file may take several minutes. For instance, populating the sentences file using `all-minilm-l6-v2` on a MacBookPro takes about 5min.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you get a `FileNotFoundError`, for instance
> `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'prompt-sentences-main/prompt_sentences.json'`
>
> It means you aren't running the script from the main `responsible-prompting-api/` folder. You need to go back into that directory and run ```python customize/customize_embeddings.py```


 2. Look into the `prompt-sentences-main` folder and you should have a new file called `prompt_sentences-all-MiniLM-L6-v2.json`

> [!NOTE]
> In case you are using another local model, you can add the model to `models` folder and change the name of the model in the output file. To do this, make changes to `model_path` variable of `customize_embeddings.py`
>```
>model_path = 'models/<name-of-your-model>'
>```
> Also, if you would like to use another sentences input file, or change the name of the input file, you can make changes to the `json_in_file variable` of `customize_embeddings.py`
>```
>json_in_file = 'prompt-sentences-main/<other-input-file-name>.json'
>```
